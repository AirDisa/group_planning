<% if @user %>
Hey <% @user.first_name %>,
<% else %>
Hey there,
<% end %>
===============================================

<%= @creator.full_name %> just invited you to the event <%= @event.title %>!

If this is your first time participating in a grouPACT, here's how it works:

1. Click this link to visit the event page: http://groupact.heroku.com/<%= @event.url %>
2. Respond to the event invite with yes, no, or yes IF.
3. Once everyone has responded or the event deadline (<%= @event.commit_date.strftime("%A, %b %e") %>) rolls around, you'll get an email letting you know if your conditions were met.

And that's all there is to it! Pretty easy, right?

Happy planning!
