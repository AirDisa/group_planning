      <h1 id="faq_header">Yannick</h1>
      <p>
        To say Yannick is a social butterfly would be akin to mistaking a Hummer for your grandma's sedan. Somehow he manages to simultaneously rock out to German dubstep, geek out with his pair over Ruby and email his mom in French. It's downright impressive.

      <h1 id="faq_header">Mitch</h1>
      <p>
        Mitch is our sometimes lovable robot of a team member. We're fairly sure that he doesn't sleep at night and simply plugs into a socket to stay energized. He also nerds out on algorithms and squashes bugs like a boss.

      <p>
        You know that guy who sits quitely in the back of the classroom and then casually crushes you come test day? That's Andrew. Oh, and his background in fine arts makes him unfairly good at front end design.
