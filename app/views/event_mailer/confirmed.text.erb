Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,
===============================================

You are now confirmed for <%= @event.title %>! We hope you enjoy it!

Here's a list of the people that will be joining you:
<% @event.going.each do |invitee| %>
-<%= invitee.user.first_name %>
<% end %>
<% if @event.down_payment %>
By the way, now that you are confirmed for the event you should be seeing a charge for <%= number_to_currency(@event.down_payment / 100.0) %> appear within the next day or two.
<% end %>

Happy (conditional) planning,
The grouPACT Team
