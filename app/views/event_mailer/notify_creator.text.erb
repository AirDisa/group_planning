Hey <%= @creator.first_name %>,
===============================================

Congrats! Your event "<%= @event.title %>" has been confirmed!

Here's a list of the people that will be joining you:
<% @event.going.each do |invitee| %>
-<%= invitee.user.first_name %>
<% end %>
<% if @event.down_payment %>
By the way, now that everyone is confirmed for the event you should be seeing a deposit for roughly <%= number_to_currency(@event.down_payment / 100.0 * (@event.going.count - 1))%> appear within the next few days.
<% end %>

Happy (conditional) planning,
The grouPACT Team
