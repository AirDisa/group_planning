Hey <%= @creator.first_name %>,
===============================================

This is just to confirm that you successfully created the event <%= @event.title %>.

Per your request, invitees will be given until <%= @event.commit_date.strftime("%A, %b %e") %> to respond before the final group is determined.

You can check back at any time to see the current status of the event. Happy planning!
